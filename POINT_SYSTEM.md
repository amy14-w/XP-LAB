## 🏆 Ranking System

### How Ranks Work
Students earn points and progress through 6 different ranks. Think of it like leveling up in a video game - the more points you earn, the higher your rank becomes.

### The 6 Ranks

| Rank | Points Needed | What It Means |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| **Bronze** | 0-149 points | You're just starting out! |
| **Silver** | 150-399 points | You're getting the hang of it! |
| **Gold** | 400-819 points | You're doing great! |
| **Platinum** | 820-1249 points | You're really good at this! |
| **Diamond** | 1250-1499 points | You're an expert! |
| **Master** | 1500+ points | You're the best of the best! |

### How It Works
- Your rank is automatically calculated based on your total points
- When you earn enough points, you automatically move up to the next rank
- Your rank is displayed on your profile and in the leaderboard
- Each rank has its own color and badge

## 💯 Points System

### How You Earn Points

#### 1. **Attendance Points**
- **Show up to class**: +15 points
- **Miss a class**: -10 points (and -5 more for each additional absence)
- **Excused absence**: 0 points (no penalty, but no bonus either)

**Example**: If you attend 5 classes in a row, you get 15 × 5 = 75 points just for showing up!

#### 2. **Answering Questions**
- **Base points**: 25 points per question
- **How it's calculated**: If you answer 6 out of 8 questions correctly, you get (6/8) × 25 × 8 = 150 points
- **Perfect score bonus**: If you get ALL questions right, you get an extra +10 points

**Example**: 
- You answer 8 questions, get 7 right
- Calculation: (7/8) × 25 × 8 = 175 points
- If you got all 8 right, you'd get 200 points (190 + 10 bonus)

#### 3. **Streak Bonus**
The longer your attendance streak, the more bonus points you get at the end of each class:

- **Day 2-8**: +2 bonus points
- **Day 9-15**: +3 bonus points  
- **Day 16-22**: +4 bonus points
- **Day 23+**: +5 bonus points

**Example**: If you have a 20-day streak, you get +4 bonus points added to your total for that class.

#### 4. **Teacher Bonus**
Your teacher can give you extra points (0-50 points) for:
- Creative answers
- Exceptional participation
- Helping other students
- Going above and beyond

**Example**: You give a really insightful answer, and your teacher awards you 30 bonus points!

### How Points Are Calculated

At the end of each class, your points are calculated like this:

```
Total Points = Attendance Points 
             + Question Points 
             + Perfect Score Bonus (if applicable)
             + Streak Bonus
             + Teacher Bonus (if any)
```

**Example Calculation**:
- Attendance: +15 points
- Questions: 6/8 correct = 150 points
- Perfect score? No (only 6/8)
- Streak bonus: 12-day streak = +3 points
- Teacher bonus: +20 points
- **Total for this class**: 15 + 150 + 0 + 3 + 20 = **188 points**

## 🔥 Streak System

### What is a Streak?
A streak is how many days in a row you've attended class. Think of it like a chain - each day you attend, you add another link. If you miss a day, the chain breaks and starts over.

### How Streaks Work
- **Per Class**: Each class has its own separate streak
- **Current Streak**: How many days in a row you've attended right now
- **Longest Streak**: Your all-time best streak (even if it's broken)

**Example**: 
- You attend Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday = 3-day streak
- You miss Thursday = streak resets to 0
- You attend Friday = 1-day streak starts
- Your longest streak is still 3 (from Monday-Wednesday)

### Streak Savers - Two Ways to Save Your Streak

#### 1. **Student Streak Saver** (Monthly)
- **How often**: Once per month
- **What it does**: Restores your broken streak back to your longest streak
- **When to use**: If you accidentally miss a class and don't want to lose your progress
- **Cooldown**: 30 days between uses

**Example**: 
- Your longest streak is 15 days
- You miss a class and your streak breaks
- You use your monthly streak saver
- Your streak is restored to 15 days!

#### 2. **Teacher Reset** (Unlimited)
- **Who can use it**: Your teacher
- **How often**: As many times as needed
- **When it's used**: 
  - Technical issues (like you couldn't check in)
  - Emergencies
  - Special circumstances
- **What it does**: Teacher can restore your streak to your longest streak or set it to a custom value

**Example**: 
- Your streak is 10 days
- You had a family emergency and missed class
- Your teacher resets your streak back to 10 days
- You don't lose your progress!
